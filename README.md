# Mini Project 2

## Description

This project will be using a 'Stars Dataset' from Kaggle.com

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/stars-dataset?resource=download

This project will show 3 different graphs that illustrate different characteristics of stars.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

```
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Executing program
```
python main.py
```

### Output

This project creates 3 graphs that have different information about stars.

Graph one shows the Changing Radius of 4 different Stars Across Varying Distances.

Graph two shows classifications of stars, and it shows how many stars are in each class.

Graph three is a heatmap that shows the distribution of star temperatures across varying distances from Earth.
